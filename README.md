Collaboration
------------

1. Clone and enter into the repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/anshul96go/CS771_Housing_Prices.git
cd path/to/cloned-directory
```

2. Contributers should make changes and test their code in their specific branch  
Each branch should be named as *user-initials* followed by *working-branch*  
Example: for initials *XYZabc* typing `git checkout -b xyzabc-working-branch` will create and checkout into the *xyzabc-working-branch*  
Omit the `-b` flag if the branch already exists  
Do not make a new branch each time some code is to be added or modified

3. Merge the branches post tests

Goal
----

Come up with a suitable technique to predict the sales price of a house given various attributes  
Use various machine learning models like support vector machines, regression, non-linear kernalized models and so on to get robust estimates of the housing prices

Data
